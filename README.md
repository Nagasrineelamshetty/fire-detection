## Fire Detection Web-App
A real-time fire detection web application built using YOLOv8 and Streamlit. This project identifies fire in both images and video streams with high accuracy, providing a simple and interactive user interface.

## Features:
Detects fire in uploaded images and live video streams

Uses YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) for object detection

Trained on a custom dataset for improved accuracy

Streamlit-based interface for seamless interaction

Displays bounding boxes around detected fire regions

## Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Model Framework: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
Web Framework: Streamlit
Image/Video Processing: OpenCV
Deep Learning Backend: PyTorch
